# Bento Nouveau

## Modern Japanese Cuisine with Traditional Roots

Welcome to Bento Nouveau, where we blend authentic Japanese flavors with contemporary culinary techniques. Our restaurant offers a serene dining experience centered around the traditional Japanese bento—a balanced, portion-controlled meal served in a compartmentalized box.

## Our Philosophy

At Bento Nouveau, we believe that food should be:
- **Balanced** - Each bento contains a thoughtful combination of proteins, vegetables, and grains
- **Seasonal** - Our menu changes quarterly to showcase the freshest seasonal ingredients
- **Sustainable** - We source locally whenever possible and minimize food waste
- **Beautiful** - We eat with our eyes first; each bento is artfully arranged

## Menu Highlights

### Signature Bentos

- **Traditional** - Grilled salmon, tamago, pickled vegetables, steamed rice, and miso soup
- **Vegetarian** - Crispy tofu, sautéed seasonal vegetables, mushroom rice, and vegetable broth
- **Premium** - A5 Wagyu beef, unagi, truffle rice, seasonal vegetables, and special dashi

### À La Carte

We also offer individual items for those who prefer to create their own dining experience.
